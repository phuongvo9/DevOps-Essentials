# Conversation between IMDS transactions to OIDC
IMDS (Instance Metadata Service) is a REST API thatâ€™s available at a well-known, non-routable IP address (169.254.169.254). You can only access it from within the VM. Communication between the VM and IMDS never leaves the host. On the other hand, OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol based on the OAuth2 protocol (which is used for authorization). OIDC uses the standardized message flows from OAuth2 to provide identity services
